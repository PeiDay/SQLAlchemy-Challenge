## Background
This project is designed to explore and analyze data of climate database by using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, and Pandas and Matplotlib in Python. A Flask API is created to store all the information.

## Climate Analysis and Exploration

### Precipitation Analysis

### Station Analysis



## Climate App



## Other Analysis
### Temperature Analysis I
#### Is there a meaningful difference between temperatures between the months of June and December?

* T-test:
Above, a paired t-test was used to calculate the means of two different independent samples: the temperature for June vs temperature for December across all available years in the dataset.

Results: t = 31.60, p = 3.90

Conclusion: With the p-value exceeding the 0.05 level of significance, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in means between June and December temperatures across all years available.

### Temperature Analysis II
Choose a date range for a trip and use the calc_temps function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for the trip using the matching dates from the previous year. Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from the query as a bar chart.


### Daily Rainfall Average
Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the year's previous matching dates for the trip.


### Daily Temperature Normals
Calculate the daily minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for the trip and plot an area plot with the results.
